methods:

    - stereo acquisition: several pictures taken by several cameras pre calibrated to reconstruct a 3d model. Downside: sensitive to lighting
    - structured light: project a structured light pattern on the surface of the object. Downside: costly, extremely sensitive to lighting and distance
    - active sensing: laser to calculate distance and a range image. Downside: expensive equipment + time-consuming

classification criteria: (depend on lighting) + (not accurate enough)

    - jaw height (point 0-4)
    - 1/2 jaw circumference (5-9)
    - forehead width (distance between 2 outer points of two eyebrows) (point 17, 26)
    - distance between 2 eyebrows (distance between 2 inner points of two eyebrows) (point 21, 22)
    - average width of eyes (point 36, 39 and point 42, 45)
    - average height of eyes (max(point 37, 41 and point 38, 40) and max(point 43, 47 and point 44, 46))
    - average distance between eyes and brows (avg(point 19, 37 and point 19, 38) and avg(point 24, 43 and point 24, 44))
    - nose length (point 27, 30)
    - nose width (nostril) (point 31, 35)
    - distance between upper lip and nostril (point 33, 51)
    - mouth width (point 48, 54)
    - upper lip height avg(point 50, 61 and point 52, 63)
    - lower lip height avg(point 56, 65 and point 58, 67)
    - distance between lower lip to chin (point 57, 9)
    - lower jawbone angle (00:5 and 5:10)
    - chin angle (point 8, 9 and point 9, 10)
    - nose angle (point 27, 30 and point 30, 33)
    - jawbone angle (point 0, 1 and point 16, 17)

    - new criteria: 4 angles above + distance between any 2 of 68 points got from modelling + average width of eyes +
    average height of eyes + average distance between eyes and brows + upper lip height + lower lip height

    - new problem: too many features, on big dataset like a dataset of employees of a company, it might not matter too
    much, but on the test dataset like I used, it could potentially break the prediction model. If encountered this
    problem, suggested that you use PCA to reduce the dimension

steps:

    - create a model
    - calculate the above criteria
    - create and matrix of information
    - normalize that matrix
    - put through an classifier (preferably ensemble)
